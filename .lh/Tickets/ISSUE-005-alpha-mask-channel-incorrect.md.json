The RGB channels from the source should be discarded for the MASK output.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Notes (Optional)\r\n(This requires modifying the image processing logic for MASK map types to specifically isolate and save only the alpha channel as a grayscale image. Need to check the relevant sections in `asset_processor.py` related to map processing and saving.)\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria (Optional)\r\n*   [ ] Process an asset containing a source image with an alpha channel intended as a MASK map.\r\n*   [ ] Verify that the output MASK file is a grayscale image (single channel) and accurately represents the alpha channel data from the source.\r\n*   [ ] Verify that the output MASK file does not contain redundant or incorrect RGB channel data."
