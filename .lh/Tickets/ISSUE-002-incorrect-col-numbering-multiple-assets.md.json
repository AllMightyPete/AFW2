For example, `Assetname1` might get `_COL-1`, `_COL-2`, while `Assetname2` incorrectly gets `_COL-3`, `_COL-4`, instead of starting its own sequence (`_COL-1`, `_COL-2`). The \"COL value accumulates across directory, not comparing names\".\r\n\r\n## Desired Behavior / Goals\r\nThe tool should correctly identify distinct asset sets within a single input directory and apply variant numbering (like \"COL-#\") independently for each asset set. The numbering should reset for each new asset encountered in the directory.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Notes (Optional)\r\n(This likely requires adjusting the file classification or inventory logic to group files by asset name before applying variant numbering rules.)\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria (Optional)\r\n*   [ ] Processing a directory containing multiple asset sets with variant map types results in correct, independent numbering for each asset set (e.g., `Assetname1_COL-1`, `Assetname1_COL-2`, `Assetname2_COL-1`, `Assetname2_COL-2`).\r\n*   [ ] The numbering is based on the files belonging to a specific asset name, not the overall count of variant maps in the entire input directory."
