Specifically, the \"base Name index\" and \"Map type index\" values within the `source_naming` section of the preset JSON are not being respected during file processing.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nWhen processing assets, the tool (observed in the GUI) does not use the specified \"base Name index\" and \"Map type index\" from the active preset's `source_naming` rules to determine the asset's base name and individual map types from the source filenames.\r\n\r\n## Desired Behavior / Goals\r\nThe tool should accurately read and apply the \"base Name index\" and \"Map type index\" values from the selected preset's `source_naming` rules to correctly parse asset base names and map types from source filenames.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Notes (Optional)\r\n(Add any thoughts on how this could be implemented, technical challenges, relevant code sections, or ideas for a solution.)\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria (Optional)\r\n(Define clear, testable criteria that must be met for the ticket to be considered complete.)\r\n*   [ ] Processing an asset with a preset that uses specific `base_name_index` and `map_type_index` values results in the correct asset name and map types being identified according to those indices.\r\n*   [ ] This behavior is consistent in both the GUI and CLI."
