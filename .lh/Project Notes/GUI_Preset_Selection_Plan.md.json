This aims to prevent accidental processing with an unintended preset and clearly indicate to the user that a preset selection is required for preview.\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\n1.  **Modify `gui/main_window.py`:**\r\n    *   Remove the logic that selects a default preset during initialization.\r\n    *   Initialize the preview table to display the text \"please select a preset\".\r\n    *   Disable the mechanism that triggers the `PredictionHandler` for preview generation until a preset is selected.\r\n    *   Update the slot connected to the preset selection signal:\r\n        *   When a preset is selected, clear the placeholder text and enable the preview generation mechanism.\r\n        *   Pass the selected preset configuration to the `PredictionHandler`.\r\n        *   Trigger the `PredictionHandler` to generate and display the preview.\r\n    *   (Optional but recommended) Add logic to handle the deselection of a preset, which should clear the preview table and display the \"please select a preset\" text again, and disable preview generation.\r\n\r\n2.  **Review `gui/prediction_handler.py`:**\r\n    *   Verify that the `PredictionHandler`'s methods that generate predictions (`get_detailed_file_predictions`) correctly handle being called only when a valid preset is provided. No major changes are expected here, but it's good practice to confirm.\r\n\r\n3.  **Update Preview Table Handling (`gui/preview_table_model.py` and `gui/main_window.py`):**\r\n    *   Ensure the `PreviewTableModel` can gracefully handle having no data when no preset is selected.\r\n    *   In `gui/main_window.py`, configure the `QTableView` or its parent widget to display the placeholder text \"please select a preset\" when the model is empty or no preset is active.\r\n\r\n## Data Flow Change\r\n\r\nThe current data flow for preview generation is roughly:\r\nInitialization -> Default Preset Loaded -> Trigger PredictionHandler -> Update Preview Table\r\n\r\nThe proposed data flow would be:\r\nInitialization -> No Preset Selected -> Preview Table Empty/Placeholder -> User Selects Preset -> Trigger PredictionHandler with Selected Preset -> Update Preview Table\r\n\r\nHere's a simplified Mermaid diagram illustrating the change in the initial state:\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\ngraph TD\r\n    A[GUI Initialization] --> B{Is a Preset Selected?};\r\n    B -- Yes (Current) --> C[Load Default Preset];\r\n    B -- No (Proposed) --> D[Preview Table Empty/Placeholder];\r\n    C --> E[Trigger PredictionHandler];\r\n    D --> F[User Selects Preset];\r\n    F --> E;\r\n    E --> G[Update Preview Table];"
