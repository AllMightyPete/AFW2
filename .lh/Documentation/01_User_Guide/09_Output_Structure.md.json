            "content": "# User Guide: Output Structure\r\n\r\nThis document describes the directory structure and contents of the processed assets generated by the Asset Processor Tool.\r\n\r\nProcessed assets are saved to: `<output_base_directory>/<supplier_name>/<asset_name>/`\r\n\r\n*   `<output_base_directory>`: The base output directory configured in `config.py` or specified via CLI/GUI.\r\n*   `<supplier_name>`: The name of the asset supplier, determined from the preset used.\r\n*   `<asset_name>`: The name of the processed asset, determined from the source filename based on preset rules.\r\n\r\n## Contents of Each Asset Directory\r\n\r\nEach asset directory contains the following:\r\n\r\n*   Processed texture maps (e.g., `AssetName_Color_4K.png`, `AssetName_NRM_2K.exr`). These are the resized, format-converted, and bit-depth adjusted texture files.\r\n*   Merged texture maps (e.g., `AssetName_NRMRGH_4K.png`). These are maps created by combining channels from different source maps based on the configured merge rules.\r\n*   Model files (if present in the source asset).\r\n*   `metadata.json`: A JSON file containing detailed information about the asset and the processing that was performed. This includes details about the maps, resolutions, formats, bit depths, merged map details, calculated image statistics, aspect ratio change information, asset category and archetype, the source preset used, and a list of ignored source files. This file is intended for use by downstream tools or scripts (like the Blender integration scripts).\r\n*   `Extra/` (subdirectory): Contains source files that were not classified as maps or models but were explicitly marked to be moved to the extra directory based on preset rules (e.g., previews, documentation files).\r\n*   `Unrecognised/` (subdirectory): Contains source files that were not classified as maps, models, or explicitly marked as extra, and were not ignored.\r\n*   `Ignored/` (subdirectory): Contains source files that were explicitly ignored during processing (e.g., an 8-bit Normal map when a 16-bit variant exists and is prioritized)."
